# Changelog

All notable changes to `@bonnard/cli` will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.11] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- `bon datasource test [name]` — test datasource connections via Cube drivers (syncs first, then tests)
- `--no-check` flag for `bon deploy` — skip connection tests during deploy
- Connection testing during `bon deploy` — tests all referenced datasources after sync, before uploading files

### Changed
- Connection testing now routes through Cube's bundled drivers instead of native DB drivers — supports all 7 warehouse types (postgres, redshift, snowflake, bigquery, databricks, duckdb, clickhouse)
- `bon datasource add` now shows "Connection will be tested during `bon deploy`" messaging

## [0.3.10] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- `--ssl` flag for `bon datasource add` — sets SSL mode for Postgres/Redshift (defaults to `require`)
- SSL Configuration section in `cubes.data-source` docs

### Fixed
- SSL not passed to Cube Postgres driver at query time — cloud databases (Neon, Supabase, RDS) now connect correctly

## [0.3.9] - 2026-02-27
